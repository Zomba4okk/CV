## WORK HISTORY
### Senior Software Engineer (08/2021 - Present)
Truck logistics system  (iTechArt Group customer)
- Seamlessly (for clients) migrated certain parts of the monolithic Django server into separate FastAPI microservices, which greatly increased the efficiency of development teams and reduced the time to deliver business functions to production.
- Optimized DB load for commonly used APIs with Datadog analysis tool, Django ORM, and Django Redis caching features, reducing DB load and cost of DB hosting.
- Seamlessly (for clients) refactored DB structure by deleting deprecated tables and distributing related data between existing ones. The action seriously decreased code complexity and increased developers' efficiency.
- Refactored monolith architecture to prepare it for future migration to microservices. The work required well understanding of microservices architecture and great planning and analyzing skills. As a result, many serious architectural problems and bottlenecks were detected early and corrected or addressed, significantly reducing the human resource costs of future migration of the application.																													
- Actively participated in the design and planning of the application's future microservices architecture, discussing and proposing solutions in both technical and business areas.
- Migrated emails to Marketing Cloud to speed up and simplify automated mailing.
### Backend developer (11/2020 - 08/2021)
Marketing and media services platform (iTechArt Group customer)
- Managed and led the team of backend engineers worked on the development of core business functionality for the backend application. The application has been successfully released with no serious issues after 9 months of work.
- Implemented code-level data synchronization across different tables and storages eliminating the need for developers to monitor data integrity and significantly increasing their efficiency.
- Optimized DB queries and memory usage addressing major performance issues in major parts of the server caused by poor application architecture. As a result, the DB load decreased by 30%, and the speed of executing the heaviest requests increased by 2-3 times.
- Integrated the Braintree payment service and all related business functionality meeting security and legal requirements. The easy and secure advertisement payment process significantly increased the number of orders.
### Full-stack developer (09/2019 - 11/2020)
Truck logistics system (iTechArt Group customer)
- Developed and integrated websocket message system from scratch, including Tornado server, JS client, and custom token-based authentication. The system has become the basis for a huge number of business features allowing customers to track their trucks and/or shipments in real-time.
- Implemented a few most actively used web pages with all related REST APIs and backend business functionality. All tasks were completed and delivered just in time with no serious bugs.
- Developed a real-time high-loaded GPS truck tracking system based on websockets and Google maps on both the FE and BE sides. The system has become one of the project's key features and significantly accelerated customer growth.
- Optimized and refactored unit tests across the project, which helped to reduce pipeline build time by 20%, reduced DB hosting price, and increased developers' efficiency.
- Introduced and configured an automated code check and formatting system including MyPy, flake8, iSort, and Black which is allow to bring all the code to a single standard, increase code readability and, as a result, speed up the development process.
### Mentor (06/2020 - Present)
iTechArt Group
- Successfully trained 4 developers.
- Two of them were invited to participate in a specific three-month student lab during interviews with me and my colleagues. They started with just basic programming knowledge and achieved junior level at the end of the course. Both have been hired as junior Python web developers at our company.
- The other two programmers were already hired junior developers with no commercial experience. I worked with them for several months teaching them the specifics of commercial development from project management to communicating with different stakeholders. As a result, both of them successfully passed the project interviews and participated in its development as qualified independent specialists.
## EDUCATION
- Belarusian-Russian University, 2017 - 2021. Information Technology engineer, Bachelor of Applied Science in Information Technology
